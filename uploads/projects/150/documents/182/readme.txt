Installing Freebyte Task Scheduler
No installation needed! Just copy the program file into a directory of your choice. Then start the program by double clicking it.

Note for Windows 7 and Windows Vista users
You might want to copy the program into another directory than 'c:\program files'. The reason is that in Windows 7/Vista a program does not have full privileges to write to 'c:\program files' or any of its subdirectories. This program needs to be able to save its setting into the directory it is residing.
